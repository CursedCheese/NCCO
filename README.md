# NCCO
CEC2025 / NMMSO and CMA-ES based Continuous Optimizer

**NCCO** is a dynamic optimization algorithm designed for continuous changes, based on **NMMSO** and **CMA-ES**. The main algorithm is implemented in ``ncco.py``, and other files can be referenced as needed. This repository is temporary and will be updated progressively.

This program cannot be executed; it serves as a reference for the algorithm section of **NCCO**. The commented sections will be translated into English later, and the code will also be refactored.
